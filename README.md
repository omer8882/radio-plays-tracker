# Radio Plays Tracker (MaHushma.com)

## Overview

Track what's playing on radio stations in real-time! This project continuously monitors radio stations, recognizes songs using Shazam and Spotify APIs, stores the data in PostgreSQL, and presents it through an interactive web interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéµ **Real-Time Recognition**: Active monitoring of 6 radio stations (Galglatz, Galatz, 100FM, 103FM, Eco99, Kan88)
- üìä **Rich Analytics**: View recently played songs, top hits, and search by timestamp
- üîç **Search Around**: Remember hearing a song Tuesday at 8am? Search by station and time to find it
- üìà **Station Breakdown**: See how many times each song was played across different stations
- üåê **Public Web UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with React and Material-UI

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend

#### **Song Recognizer** (`backend/recognize/`)
Python service that captures radio streams and identifies songs.
- **Stack**: Python 3.x, ShazamIO, Spotify API, psycopg2
- **Function**: Continuously listens to radio streams, recognizes songs, enriches metadata
- **Database**: Writes directly to PostgreSQL

#### **API Server** (`backend/dotnet-server/`)
RESTful API built with .NET 8+ following Clean Architecture principles.
- **Stack**: ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL (Npgsql)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Api ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Infrastructure layers)
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/station_last_plays` - Recent plays by station
  - `/api/top_hits` - Most played songs in last 7/30 days
  - `/api/search_around` - Find songs by timestamp
  - `/api/song_details` - Detailed song information
  - `/api/stations` - List all monitored stations

### Frontend (`frontend/radio-plays/`)

React SPA with Material-UI providing an intuitive interface for exploring radio play data.
- **Stack**: React, Material-UI, Axios
- **Features**: Real-time updates, responsive design, station-specific views

### Database

PostgreSQL with normalized schema optimized for time-series queries:
- **Tables**: songs, artists, albums, stations, plays (with junction tables)
- **Indexes**: Optimized for timestamp-based queries and fuzzy text search (pg_trgm)
- **Timezone**: All timestamps stored in (Asia/Jerusalem) time 


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 14+ (with timezone set to `Asia/Jerusalem`)
- .NET 8+ SDK
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Spotify API credentials ([Get them here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Create database and initialize schema
cd backend/dotnet-server
psql -U postgres -f scripts/init-db.sql
```

### 2. Configuration

```bash
# Copy template and add your credentials
cd backend/recognize
cp config.template.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your Spotify API keys and PostgreSQL password
```

See [CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md](CONFIG_MANAGEMENT.md) for details on managing secrets.

### 3. Backend Services

#### .NET API Server
```bash
cd backend/dotnet-server/src/RadioPlaysTracker.Api
dotnet restore
dotnet run
# API runs on https://localhost:5001
```

#### Python Song Recognizer
```bash
cd backend/recognize
pip install -r requirements.txt
python recognizer.py
```

### 4. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend/radio-plays
npm install
npm start
# Web UI runs on http://localhost:3000
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Backend**
- .NET 8+ (ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core)
- Python 3.x (ShazamIO, psycopg2, requests)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (Npgsql, pg_trgm extension)

**Frontend**
- React 18+
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Axios

**APIs**
- Spotify Web API
- ShazamIO (song recognition)

> **Why so many technologies???** Mixing .NET, Python, PostgreSQL, and React all for one small website justifyingly seems like an overkill, but it's all about embracing challenges and exploring different tools. Each tech was chosen to solve specific problems and honestly - because learning new things is fun.
